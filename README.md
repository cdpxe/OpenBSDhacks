# OpenBSDhacks
Some of my security-related coding projects for OpenBSD. Please note that I wrote these codes when I was in school (FUPIDS) or in my second undergrad semester (openportd). These codes/patches were crafted to work with OpenBSD 3.3 (or so). More of my research projects and papers can be found on [my website](https://www.wendzel.de).

The following projects are located here:

* [FUPIDS](https://github.com/cdpxe/OpenBSDhacks/tree/master/FUPIDS): A "fuzzy" user-profile IDS for OpenBSD; written around 2002
* [openportd](https://github.com/cdpxe/OpenBSDhacks/tree/master/openportd): "port knocking" service, but actually not using ports (it uses ICMP instead), for OpenBSD; written in 2006
* [patches](https://github.com/cdpxe/OpenBSDhacks/tree/master/patches): some patches for OpenBSD kernel/userland
