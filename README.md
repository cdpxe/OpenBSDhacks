# OpenBSDhacks
Some of my security-related coding projects for OpenBSD. Please note that I wrote these codes when I was in school (FUPIDS) or in my second undergrad semester (openportd). These codes are designed to work with OpenBSD 3.3 (or so).

The following projects are located here:

* [FUPIDS](https://github.com/cdpxe/OpenBSDhacks/tree/master/FUPIDS): A "fuzzy" user-profile IDS for OpenBSD; written in 2002/2002
* [openportd](https://github.com/cdpxe/OpenBSDhacks/tree/master/openportd): "port knocking" service, but actually not using ports (it uses ICMP instead), for OpenBSD; written in 2006
